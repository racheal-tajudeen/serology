<H3>Serology is the scientific study of blood serum and other bodily fluids to detect and measure the presence of antibodies, antigens, and other immune-related substances.<br /> It is commonly used to diagnose infections, determine immune status, and identify autoimmune conditions. Serological tests can help detect the presence of specific antibodies or antigens related to pathogens like viruses, bacteria, or fungi, indicating a current or past infection. <BR />They are also essential in blood typing, vaccine efficacy studies, and in the diagnosis of conditions such as autoimmune diseases and allergies.
